    question: "Why even having a relationship with an AI?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        - Humans can be intimidating and judgemental<br />
        + AI can be less intimidating because you know it's a computer not a real person, they can't judge<br />
        <br />
        - Humans have memories and can leak secrets<br />
        + AI chats obviously can't be hacked. You can delete its memory when you want e.g. after a chat, making that risk close to zero.
